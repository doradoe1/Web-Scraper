# COSC_6375_Final_Project-Web_Table_Scraper
 In this project, we are going to use a python script to scrap data from a table in a well-known website in the United Kingdom. The process will be described in detail, along with the reasoning of the code. A basic understanding of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and CSS is needed in order to understand and build a successful scraping script.
